Tajudeen Ajide, current chairman of Surulere Local Government, is a fine mix of two subjects: football and politics. Born to a grassroots politician father, Ajide showed strong leadership quality on the streets of Surulere, where he was born and bred.Popularly known as ‘Sportcity’, Surulere is home to two major stadia in Nigeria’s commercial city of Lagos and these provided opportunities for youngsters like Tajudeen Ajide to flourish in football, the most popular game in Nigeria.“As a kid,” he started, “my brothers and I would comb the whole of Lagos to play in youth football competitions and there is no football field that we did not play, most especially in Surulere axis, where we grew up. There is no play ground that we did not play football.Three of us, Ganiyu Ajide (former Super Eagles defender), my older brother, and I played for a grassroots team and we usually moved from Campos to Isale-Eko, Sawdust, Whitesand, Obalende and many other football fields because this was the kind of thing that brought respect to kids of my era. Grassroots football kept us away from crime and other vices and even in the off season you would still see us hanging together and playing off season competitions. Those things develop the mind and make you responsible". The street games, he said, prepared him for the man he is today.</p>
